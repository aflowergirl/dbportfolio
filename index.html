			<h2>hello world!</h2>
			<p>This site is a showcase of my student work. My ultimate goal is to obtain a position that I can utilize my abilities as a web designer, but also become a member of a team in a positive environment that presents challenge and promotes growth. I have been working as a digital prepress mac operator and production artist for over 20 years and have a diverse graphic arts background with roots in printing. I polished my skills in Photoshop, color correcting images, photo retouching and image manipulation, and over the years, honed my design skills utilizing Adobe Creative Suite. With my diversified background, I bring a wide range of skills to the table, to some I am considered a 'jack of all trades.'</p>

			<h2>volunteerism</h2>
			<p>Many years ago, while living in San Diego, I started volunteering at a small non-profit organic educational farm. Working the land, growing food and educating people of all ages was a stepping stone of my love for gardening, growing my own food and establishing a medicinal herb garden in my own garden. I have been studying the properties and uses of medicinal herbs and enjoy growing them in my garden. My journey of volunteerism has taken me from Wild Willow Farm in San Diego, CA to Memphis Botanical Garden in Memphis, TN, Yew Dell Botanical Garden in Crestwood, KY and recently becoming a volunteer for the new Waterfront Botanical Gardens in Louisville, KY.</p>
