				<h2>hello world!</h2>
				<p>This site is a showcase of my web projects and photography. My ultimate goal is to obtain a position that I can utilize my abilities as a front-end web designer and production artist, but also become a member of a team in a positive environment that presents challenge and promotes growth. </p>
				<p>I have been working as a digital prepress mac operator and production artist for over 20 years and have a diverse graphic arts background with roots in printing. I polished my skills in Photoshop, color correcting images, photo retouching and image manipulation, and over the years, honed my design skills utilizing Adobe Creative Suite and am gaining new skills in coding html, css and javascript through the Code Louisville program. With my diversified background, I bring a wide range of knowledge to the table, to some I am considered a 'jack of all trades.'</p>
				<h2>community involvement</h2>
				<p>Many years ago, while living in San Diego, I started volunteering at a small, non-profit, organic, educational farm. Working the land, growing food and educating people of all ages was a stepping stone of my love for gardening, growing my own food and growing medicinal herbs in my garden. I have been studying the properties, uses, propagation and cultivation of medicinal herbs since 2011. My journey of community gardens and volunteering has taken me from Wild Willow Farm in San Diego, CA to Memphis Botanical Garden in Memphis, TN, Yew Dell Botanical Garden in Crestwood, KY and recently becoming a volunteer for the new Waterfront Botanical Gardens in Louisville, KY.</p>
				<p>Before landing in Louisville, I paired my admiration of herbs with my artistic talent and landed a voluntary position with the Memphis Herb Society. For over a year I maintained their website, social media and edited and designed their monthly newsletter. It was a great experience being able to combine all of my interests and promote the herb society.</p>
