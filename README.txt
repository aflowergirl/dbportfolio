## Description
```
This project is a start for a portfolio site. I contains a gallery of my work and my resume. You can also download or print my resume from this site as well.


## Custom CSS Classes
```

1. base css is the main css, nothing fancy trying to keep it simple
2. flexbox css for responsive web functionality
3. lightbox css for the functionality of the gallery page
4. print css for the handling of the print document option


## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I used are:

1. lightbox, for the gallery page
2. a simple javascript for the print function on my bio page to print my resume
